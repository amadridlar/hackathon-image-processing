# Create a black image
img = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)

# Draw a diagonal blue line with thickness of 5 px
# PARAMETERS
# img : The image where you want to draw the shapes
# color : Color of the shape. for BGR, pass it as a tuple, eg: (255,0,0) for blue. For grayscale, just pass the scalar value.
# thickness : Thickness of the line or circle etc. If -1 is passed for closed figures like circles, it will fill the shape. default thickness = 1
# lineType : Type of line, whether 8-connected, anti-aliased line etc. By default, it is 8-connected. cv2.LINE_AA gives anti-aliased line which looks great for curves.
